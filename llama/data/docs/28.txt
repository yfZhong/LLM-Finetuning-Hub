Section text:He is a 24-year-old male who said that he had gotten into some poison ivy this weekend while he was fishing.  He has had several cases of this in the past and he says that is usually takes quite awhile for him to get over it; he said that the last time he was here he got a steroid injection by Dr. Blackman; it looked like it was Depo-Medrol 80 mg.  He said that it worked fairly well, although it seemed to still take awhile to get rid of it.  He has been using over-the-counter Benadryl as well as cortisone cream on the areas of the rash and having a little bit of improvement, but this last weekend he must have gotten into some more poison ivy because he has got another outbreak along his chest, legs, arms and back.
