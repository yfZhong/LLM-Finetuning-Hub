Section text:1.  History of recurrent abscesses in the perineum, upper medial thigh, and the vulva area for about 2 years.  Per her report, a dermatologist had told her that she had an overactive sweat gland, and I believe she probably has hidradenitis suppurativa.  Probably, she has had Staphylococcus infection associated with it as well. 2.  Reported history of asthma.
