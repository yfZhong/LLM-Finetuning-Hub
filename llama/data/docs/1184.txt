Section text:The patient is a 65-year-old female who underwent left upper lobectomy for stage IA non-small cell lung cancer.  She returns for a routine surveillance visit. She has undergone since her last visit an abdominopelvic CT, which shows an enlarging simple cyst of the left kidney.  She underwent barium swallow, which demonstrates a small sliding hiatal hernia with minimal reflux.  She has a minimal delayed emptying secondary tertiary contractions.  PA and lateral chest x-ray from the 11/23/09 was also reviewed, which demonstrates no lesions or infiltrates.  Review of systems, the patient continues to have periodic odynophagia and mid thoracic dysphagia.  This most likely is secondary to tertiary contractions with some delayed emptying.  She has also had increased size of the left calf without tenderness, which has not resolved over the past several months.  She has had a previous DVT in 1975 and 1985.  She denies weight loss, anorexia, fevers, chills, headaches, new aches or pains, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath at rest, or dyspnea on exertion.
