Section text:This 46-year-old white male with Down's syndrome presents with his mother for followup of hypothyroidism, as well as onychomycosis.  He has finished six weeks of Lamisil without any problems.  He is due to have an ALT check today.  At his appointment in April, I also found that he was hypothyroid with elevated TSH.  He was started on Levothroid 0.1 mg and has been taking that daily.  We will recheck a TSH today as well.  His mother notes that although he does not like to take the medications, he is taking it with encouragement.  His only other medications are some eyedrops for his cornea.
