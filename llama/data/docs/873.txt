Section text:ABC is in today for a followup of her atrial fibrillation.  They have misplaced the Cardizem.  She is not on this and her heart rate is up just a little bit today.  She does complain of feeling dizziness, some vertigo, some lightheadedness, and has attributed this to the Coumadin therapy.  She is very adamant that she wants to stop the Coumadin.  She is tired of blood draws.  We have had a difficult time getting her regulated.  No chest pains.  No shortness of breath.  She is moving around a little bit better.  Her arm does not hurt her.  Her back pain is improving as well.
