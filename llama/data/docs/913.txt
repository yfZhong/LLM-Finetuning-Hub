Section text:Mom brings the patient in today for possible ear infection.  He is complaining of left ear pain today.  He was treated on 04/14/2004, with amoxicillin for left otitis and Mom said he did seem to get better but just started complaining of the left ear pain today.  He has not had any fever but the congestion has continued to be very thick and purulent.  It has never really resolved.  He has a loose, productive-sounding cough but not consistently and not keeping him up at night.  No wheezing or shortness of breath.
