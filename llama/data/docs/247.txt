Section text:She has been followed for her hydrocephalus since 2002.  She also had an anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion from C3 though C5 in March 2007.  She was last seen by us in clinic in March 2008 and she was experiencing little bit of head fullness and ringing in the ears at that time; however, we decided to leave her shunt setting at 1.0.  We wanted her to followup with Dr. XYZ regarding the MRI of the cervical spine.  Today, she tells me that with respect to her bladder last week she had some episodes of urinary frequency, however, this week she is not experiencing the same type of episodes.  She reports no urgency, incontinence, and feels that she completely empties her bladder when she goes.  She does experience some leakage with coughing.  She wears the pad on a daily basis.  She does not think that her bladder has changed much since we saw her last.  With respect to her thinking and memory, she reports no problems at this time.  She reports no headaches at this time.  With respect to her walking and balance, she says that it feels worse.  In the beginning of May, she had a coughing spell and at that time she developed buttock pain, which travels down the legs.  She states that her leg often feel like elastic and she experiences a tingling radiculopathy.  She says that this tingling is constant and at times painful.  She feels that she is walking slower for this reason.  She does not use the cane at this time.  Most of the time, she is able to walk over uneven surfaces.  She is able to walk up and down stairs and has no trouble getting in and out of a car.
