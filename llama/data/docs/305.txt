Section text:The patient is a 7-year-old male who comes in today with a three-day history of emesis and a four-day history of diarrhea.  Apparently, his brother had similar symptoms.  They had eaten some chicken and then ate some more of it the next day, and I could not quite understand what the problem was because there is a little bit of language barrier, although dad was trying very hard to explain to me what had happened.  But any way, after he and his brother got done eating with chicken, they both felt bad and have continued to feel bad.  The patient has had diarrhea five to six times a day for the last four days and then he had emesis pretty frequently three days ago and then has just had a couple of it each day in the last two days.  He has not had any emesis today.  He has urinated this morning.  His parents are both concerned because he had a fever of 103 last night.  Also, he ate half of a hamburger yesterday and he tried drinking some milk and that is when he had an emesis.  He has been drinking Pedialyte, Gatorade, white grape juice, and 7Up, otherwise he has not been eating anything.
