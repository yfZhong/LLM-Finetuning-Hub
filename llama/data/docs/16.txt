Section text:This is the initial clinic visit for a 29-year-old man who is seen for new onset of right shoulder pain.  He states that this began approximately one week ago when he was lifting stacks of cardboard.  The motion that he describes is essentially picking up a stack of cardboard at his waist level, twisting to the right and delivering it at approximately waist level.  Sometimes he has to throw the stacks a little bit as well.  He states he felt a popping sensation on 06/30/04.  Since that time, he has had persistent shoulder pain with lifting activities.  He localizes the pain to the posterior and to a lesser extent the lateral aspect of the shoulder.  He has no upper extremity .
