Section text:The patient is a 10-year-old right-hand dominant male, who threw himself off a quad on 10/10/2007.  The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his left elbow fracture dislocation.  The patient also sustained a nondisplaced right glenoid neck fracture.  The patient's fracture has healed without incident, although he had significant postoperative stiffness for which he is undergoing physical therapy, as well as use of a Dynasplint.  The patient is neurologically intact distally.  Given the fact that his fracture has healed, surgery was recommended for hardware removal to decrease his irritation with elbow extension from the hardware.  Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed.  The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to remove hardware, failure to relieve pain, continued postoperative stiffness.  All questions were answered and the parents agreed to the above plan.
