She does complain that she has had a little pain with the bowel movement, and every now and then she notices a little bright red bleeding.  She has not been particularly constipated but her husband says she is not eating her vegetables like she should.  Her seasonal allergies have back developed and she is complaining of extremely itchy watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, and kind of a pressure sensation in her ears.
