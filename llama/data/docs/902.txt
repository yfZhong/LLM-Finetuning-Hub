Section text:This is a 50-year-old male who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Department with complaints of left ankle pain and disfigurement.  There was no open injury.  The patient fell approximately 10 feet off his liner, landing on his left foot.  There was evidence of gross deformity of the ankle.  An x-ray was performed in the Emergency Room, which revealed a grade IV Hawkins classification talus fracture.  He was distal neurovascularly intact.  The patient denied any other complaints besides pain in the ankle. It was for this reason, we elected to undergo the  procedure in order to reduce and restore the blood supply to the talus body.  Because of its tenuous blood supply, the patient is at risk for avascular necrosis.  The patient has agreed to undergo the above-named procedure and consent was obtained.  All risks as well as complications were discussed.
