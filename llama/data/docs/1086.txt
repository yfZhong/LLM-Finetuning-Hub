She has had no major respiratory difficulties; however, starting yesterday she began with increasing back and joint pain and as a result a deep breath has caused some back discomfort.  She denies any problems with cough or sputum production.  No fevers or chills.  Recently, she has had a bit more problems with fatigue.  For the most part, she has had no pulmonary limitations to her activity.
