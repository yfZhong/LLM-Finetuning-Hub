Section text:The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, who was last seen in rheumatology clinic approximately 4 months ago for bilateral hand discomfort, left greater than right.  The patient was seen on 10/30/07.  She had the same complaint.  She was given a trial of Elavil at bedtime because the thought was to see that represented ulnar or radial neuropathy.  She was also given a prescription for Zostrix cream but was unable to get it filled because of insurance coverage.  The patient reports some worsening of the symptoms especially involving at the dorsum of the left hand, and she points to the area that actually involves the dorsal aspect of the second, third, and fourth digits.

She has not had any night sweats or chills.  She has had no recent problems with chest pain, chest discomfort, shortness of breath or problems with GU or GI complaints.
