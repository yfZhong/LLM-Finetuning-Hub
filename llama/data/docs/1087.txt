Section text:This 49-year-old white male, established patient in dermatology, last seen in the office on 08/02/2002, comes in today for initial evaluation of a hyperesthesia on his right abdomen, then on his left abdomen, then on his left medial thigh.  It cleared for awhile.  This has been an intermittent problem.  Now it is back again on his right lower abdomen.  At first, it was thought that he may have early zoster.  This started six weeks before the holidays and is still going on, more so in the past eight days on his abdomen and right hip area.  He has had no treatment on this; there are no skin changes at all.  The patient bathes everyday but tries to use little soap.  The patient is married.  He works as an airplane mechanic.
