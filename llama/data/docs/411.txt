Section text:The patient is a 33-year-old black male who comes in to the office today main complaint of sexual dysfunction.  Patient reports that he would like to try Cialis to see if it will improve his erectile performance.  Patient states that he did a quiz on-line at the Cialis web site and did not score in the normal range, so he thought he should come in.  Patient states that perhaps his desire has been slightly decreased, but that has not been the primary problem.  In discussing with me directly, patient primarily expresses that he would like to have his erections last longer.  However, looking at the quiz as he filled it out, he reported that much less than half the time was he able to get erections during sexual activity and only about half of the time he was able to maintain his erection after penetration.  However, he only reports that it is slightly difficult to maintain the erection until completion of intercourse.  Patient has no significant past medical history.  He has never had any previous testicular infections.  He denies any history of injuries to the groin and he has never been told that he has a hernia.
