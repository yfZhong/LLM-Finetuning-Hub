Section text:The patient has been followed elsewhere, and we reviewed his records.  Essentially, he has had a trigger finger and a mucocyst, and he has had injections.  This has been going on for several months.  He is now here for active treatment because the injections were not helpful, nonoperative treatment has not worked, and he would like to move forward in order to prevent this from keeping on locking and causing his pain.  He is referred over here for evaluation regarding that.
