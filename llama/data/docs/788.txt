Section text:This 21 month old male presented for delayed motor development, "jaw quivering" and "lazy eye." He was an 8 pound 10 ounce product of a full term, uncomplicated pregnancy-labor-spontaneous vaginal delivery to a G3P3 married white female mother. There had been no known toxic intrauterine exposures. He had no serious illnesses or hospitalizations since birth. He sat independently at 7 months, stood at 11 months, crawled at 16 months, but did not cruise until 18 months. He currently cannot walk and easily falls. His gait is reportedly marked by left "intoeing." His upper extremity strength and coordination reportedly appear quite normal and he is able to feed himself, throw and transfer objects easily. He knows greater than 20 words and speaks two-word phrases. No seizures or unusual behavior were reported except for "quivering" movement of his jaw. This has occurred since birth. In addition the parents have noted transient left exotropia.
