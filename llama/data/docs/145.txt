Section text:This is a 70-year-old male who has no particular complaints other than he has just discomfort on his right side.  We have done EMG studies.  He has noticed it since his stroke about five years ago.  He has been to see a neurologist.  We have tried different medications and it just does not seem to help.  He checks his blood sugars at home two to three times a day.  He kind of adjusts his own insulin himself.  Re-evaluation of symptoms is essentially negative.  He has a past history of heavy tobacco and alcohol usage.
