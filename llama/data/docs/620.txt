Section text:The patient returns for followup.  Since last consultation she has tolerated Lamictal well, but she has had a recurrence of her myoclonic jerking.  She has not had a generalized seizure.  She is very concerned that this will occur.  Most of the myoclonus is in the mornings.  Recent EEG did show polyspike and slow wave complexes bilaterally, more prominent on the left.  She states that she has been very compliant with the medications and is getting a good amount of sleep.  She continues to drive. Social history and review of systems are discussed  and documented on the chart.
