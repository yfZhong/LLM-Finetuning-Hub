Section text:This is a 29-year-old Vietnamese female, established patient of dermatology, last seen in our office on 07/13/04.  She comes in today as a referral from ABC, D.O. for a reevaluation of her hand eczema.  I have treated her with Aristocort cream, Cetaphil cream, increased moisturizing cream and lotion, and wash her hands in Cetaphil cleansing lotion.  She comes in today for reevaluation because she is flaring.  Her hands are very dry, they are cracked, she has been washing with soap.  She states that the Cetaphil cleansing lotion apparently is causing some burning and pain because of the fissures in her skin.  She has been wearing some gloves also apparently.  The patient is single.  She is unemployed.
