Section text:This 51y/o RHF fell four times on 1/3/93, because her "legs suddenly gave out." She subsequently noticed weakness involving the right leg, and often required the assistance of her arms to move it. During some of these episodes she appeared mildly pale and felt generally weak; her husband would give her 3 teaspoons of sugar and she would appear to improve, thought not completely. During one episode she held her RUE in an "odd fisted posture." She denied any other focal weakness, sensory change, dysarthria, diplopia, dysphagia or alteration of consciousness. She did not seek medical attention despite her weakness. Then, last night, 1/4/93, she fell again ,and because her weakness did not subsequently improve she came to UIHC for evaluation on 1/5/93.
