Section text:The patient was removed from the backboard within the first half hour of her emergency department stay.  The patient has no significant bony deformities or abnormalities.  The patient is given a dose of Tylenol here in the emergency department for treatment of her pain.  Her pain is controlled with medication and she is feeling more comfortable and removed from the backboard.  The patient's CT scans of the abdomen appeared normal.  She has no signs of bleeding.  I believe, she has just a contusion and abrasion to her abdomen from the seatbelt and likely from the airbag as well.  The patient is able to stand and walk through the emergency department without difficulty.  She has no abrasions or lacerations.
