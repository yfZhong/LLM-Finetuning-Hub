Section text:This is a 14-month-old child who apparently was near the sink, got into the childproof cabinet and pulled out ant bait that had Borax in it.  It had 11 mL of this fluid in it.  She spilled it on her, had it on her hands.  Parents were not sure whether she ingested any of it.  So, they brought her in for evaluation.  They did not note any symptoms of any type.
