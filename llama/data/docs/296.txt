Section text:This is a 6-year-old male who comes in rechecking his ADHD medicines.  We placed him on Adderall, first time he has been on a stimulant medication last month.  Mother said the next day, he had a wonderful improvement, and he has been doing very well with the medicine.  She has two concerns.  It seems like first thing in the morning after he takes the medicine and it seems like it takes a while for the medicine to kick in.  It wears off about 2 and they have problems in the evening with him.  He was initially having difficulty with his appetite but that seems to be coming back but it is more the problems early in the morning after he takes this medicine than in the afternoon when the thing wears off.  His teachers have seen a dramatic improvement and she did miss a dose this past weekend and said he was just horrible.  The patient even commented that he thought he needed his medication.
