Section text:This is an 11-year-old female who comes in for two different things.  1.  She was seen by the allergist.  No allergies present, so she stopped her Allegra, but she is still real congested and does a lot of snorting.  They do not notice a lot of snoring at night though, but she seems to be always like that.  2.  On her right great toe, she has got some redness and erythema.  Her skin is kind of peeling a little bit, but it has been like that for about a week and a half now.
