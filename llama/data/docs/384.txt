Section text:Grandfather brings the patient in today because of headaches, mostly in her face.  She is feeling pressure there with a lot of sniffles.  Last night, she complained of sore throat and a loose cough.  Over the last three days, she has had a rash on her face, back and arms.  A lot of fifth disease at school.  She says it itches and they have been doing some Benadryl for this.  She has not had any wheezing lately and is not taking any ongoing medications for her asthma.
