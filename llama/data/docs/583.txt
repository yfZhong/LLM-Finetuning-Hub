Section text:He is a 29-year-old white male who is a patient of Dr. XYZ and he comes in today complaining that he was stung by a Yellow Jacket Wasp yesterday and now has a lot of swelling in his right hand and right arm.  He says that he has been stung by wasps before and had similar reactions.  He just said that he wanted to catch it early before he has too bad of a severe reaction like he has had in the past.  He has had a lot of swelling, but no anaphylaxis-type reactions in the past; no shortness of breath or difficultly with his throat feeling like it is going to close up or anything like that in the past; no racing heart beat or anxiety feeling, just a lot of localized swelling where the sting occurs.
