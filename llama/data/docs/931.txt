Section text:This is a 4-year-old white male, apparently dominantly right-handed who suffered a severe injury to his left distal humerus after jumping off of a swing.  He apparently had not had previous problems with his left arm.  He was seen in the Emergency with a grossly deformed left elbow.  His parents' were both present preoperatively.  His x-ray exam as well as physical exam was consistent with a closed type-III supracondylar fracture of the left distal humerus with rather severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with significant ecchymosis in the same region.  Gross neurologic exam revealed his ulnar, median, and radial nerves to be mostly intact, although a complete exam was impossible.  He did have a radial pulse palpable.
