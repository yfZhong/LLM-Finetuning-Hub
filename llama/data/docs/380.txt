Section text:This is a return visit for this patient who has refractory hypertension.  This seems to be doing very well given her current blood pressure reading, at least much improved from what she had been previously.  We had discussed with her in the past beginning to see an internist at the senior center.  She apparently had an appointment scheduled and it was missed.  We are going to reschedule that today given her overall state of well-being and the fact that she has no evidence of GFR that is greater than 60%.
