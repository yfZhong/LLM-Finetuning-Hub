Section text:This 34-year-old gentleman awoke this morning noting some itchiness to his back and then within very a short period of time realized that he had an itchy rash all over his torso and arms.  No facial swelling.  No tongue or lip swelling.  No shortness of breath, wheezing, or other associated symptoms.  He cannot think of anything that could have triggered this off.  There have been no changes in his foods, medications, or other exposures as far as he knows.  He states a couple of days ago he did work and was removing some insulation but does not remember feeling itchy that day.
