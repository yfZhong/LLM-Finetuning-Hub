Section text:This is a 61-year-old woman with a history of polyarteritis nodosa, mononeuritis multiplex involving the lower extremities, and severe sleep apnea returns in followup following an overnight sleep study, on CPAP and oxygen to evaluate her for difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep.  She returns today to review results of an inpatient study performed approximately two weeks ago. In the meantime, the patient reports she continues on substantial doses of opiate medication to control leg pain from mononeuritis multiplex. She also takes Lasix for lower extremity edema. The patient reports that she generally initiates sleep on CPAP, but rips her mask off, tosses and turns throughout the night and has "terrible quality sleep."
