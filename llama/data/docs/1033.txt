Section text:A 77-year-old white female who is having more problems with joint pain.  It seems to be all over decreasing her mobility, hands and wrists.  No real swelling but maybe just a little more uncomfortable than they have been.  The Daypro generic does not seem to be helping at all.  No fever or chills.  No erythema. She actually is doing better.  Her diarrhea now has settled down and she is having less urinary incontinence, less pedal edema.  Blood sugars seem to be little better as well. The patient also has gotten back on her Zoloft because she thinks she may be depressed, sleeping all the time, just not herself and really is disturbed that she cannot be more mobile in things.  She has had no polyuria, polydipsia, or other problems.  No recent blood pressure checks.
