Section text:The patient is an 18-year-old girl brought in by her father today for evaluation of a right knee injury.  She states that approximately 3 days ago while playing tennis she had a non-contact injury in which she injured the right knee.  She had immediate pain and swelling.  At this time, she complains of pain and instability in the knee.  The patient's past medical history is significant for having had an ACL injury to the knee in 2008.  She underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by Dr. X at that time, subsequently in the same year she developed laxity of the graft due in part to noncompliance and subsequently, she sought attention from Dr. Y who performed a revision ACL reconstruction at the end of 2008.  The patient states she rehabbed the knee well after that and did fine with good stability of the knee until this recent injury.
