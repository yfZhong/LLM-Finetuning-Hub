Section text:The patient is an 85-year-old female who presents with a chief complaint as described above. The patient is a very poor historian and is extremely hard of hearing, and therefore, very little history is available. She was found by EMS sitting on the toilet having diarrhea, and apparently had also just vomited. Upon my questioning of the patient, she can confirm that she has been sick to her stomach and has vomited. She cannot tell me how many times. She is also unable to describe the vomitus. She also tells me that her belly has been hurting. I am unable to get any further history from the patient because, again, she is an extremely poor historian and very hard of hearing.
