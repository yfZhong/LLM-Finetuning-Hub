Section text:The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman, a patient of Mrs. A, who was referred to me because the patient developed iron deficiency anemia and he had blood in his stool.  The patient also has chronic diarrhea.  His anemia was diagnosed months ago when he presented with unusual pruritus and he got a CBC.  At that time he was discovered to have hemoglobin of 9 and MCV 65.  The patient also had multiple episodes of dark blood and bright blood in the stool for the last 5 months on and off.  Last colonoscopy was performed by Dr. X in Las Cruces 3 years ago.  At that time the patient had polyps removed from the colon, all of them were hyperplastic in nature.  The patient also was diagnosed with lymphocytic colitis.  He was not treated for diarrhea for more than 3 years.
