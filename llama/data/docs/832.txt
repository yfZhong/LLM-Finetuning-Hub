Section text:The patient is a pleasant, 31-year-old, right-handed, white female who injured her shoulder while transferring a patient back on 01/01/02.  She formerly worked for Veteran's Home as a CNA.  She has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder.  She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002.  She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy.  He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms.  He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out.  MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03.  She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X.  She comes to me for impairment rating.  She has no chronic health problems otherwise, fevers, chills, or general malaise.  She is not working.  She is right-hand dominant.  She denies any prior history of injury to her shoulder.
